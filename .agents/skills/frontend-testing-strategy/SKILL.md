# Frontend testing strategy

Do not test everything. Do not add a new test runner.

| Kind                           | Test?                             | How                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Pure transforms / money / RBAC | Yes                               | Vitest unit           |
| Stateful hooks                 | When logic is meaningful or asked | unit                  |
| Shared interactive component   | When behavior-rich or asked       | component             |
| Forms                          | Non-trivial rules or asked        | component             |
| Critical checkout path         | When asked                        | Playwright `test:e2e` |

Test behavior ("user sees error", "canCancel is false"), not implementation ("useEffect ran").

When the user did not ask, add tests only for new non-trivial pure logic. Do not emit a `.test.tsx` per component.

Existing: `pnpm test` (Vitest, `src/**`) and `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright, `tests/e2e`).
